This file contains notes on how to collect a new set of Daikon measurements.

!UNFINISHED!

Setup a standard corpus testcase directory and then copy the three files listed below
into that directory. 

To run with DynComp you will need to have a diakon enlistment and have set the
usual envrionment variables to point there.  If you have local changes to 
the daikon tool set that you wish to test, you will need to copy your daikon.jar
to the testcase/lib directory.

To run the test process cd to the testcase directory and run:

  bash -v ./collect-inv-numbers.sh 2>&1 | tee results.log

To run entire collect-inv-numbers script on eel takes about 3.5 hours.


WARNING: At the present time this process will not work. There are required changes to
some files in the integration-test2 and do-like-javac repositories that have not 
been pushed.

collect-inv-numbers.sh
count-inv.pl
runone.py

runone.py is a sightly modified version of run_dyntrace that uses the 'dyntracecounts'
tool to run daikon twice: first normally and the with ??? config option to collect
the total number of possible invariants.

count-inv.pl is a perl script that processes the individual log files generated by
collect-inv-numbers and displays the invariant counts.
